AirPods Max, like the AirPods Pro, come with Apple's Active Noise Cancellation technology for blocking outside noise, and Transparency mode for listening to sounds around users. The \"Digital Crown\", similar to that of the Apple Watch, allows users to play or pause audio, control volume, skip tracks, control phone calls, and activate Siri. Proximity sensors automatically detect when they are on a user's head and play or pause audio accordingly. Spatial audio uses built-in gyroscopes and accelerometers to track movement of the user's head and provide what Apple describes as a \"theater-like\" experience.\r\n\r\nApple claims 20 hours of battery life, with five minutes of charging delivering 1.5 hours of listening time. AirPods Max are charged via the Lightning port. The Lightning port can also be used for line-in audio, with Apple selling cables with USB-A, USB-C and 3.5mm headphone ends.\r\n\r\nAirPods Max are bundled with a Smart Case for storing. The Smart Case includes magnets that switch AirPods Max to low-power mode.\r\n\r\nAirPods Max is available in five colors: Space Gray, Silver, Sky Blue, Green, and Pink. Users can select from these five colors separately for the ear cushions and external chassis for a total of 25 color combinations (or 125 if using two different ear cushion colors).",

      "description": "The Apple Watch is a line of smartwatches produced by Apple Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking, health-oriented capabilities, and wireless telecommunication, and integrates with iOS and other Apple products and services. The Apple Watch was released in April 2015, and quickly became the best-selling wearable device: 4.2 million were sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, and more than 115 million people were estimated to use an Apple Watch as of December 2022. Apple has introduced a new generation of the Apple Watch with improved internal components each September—each labeled by Apple as a 'Series', with certain exceptions.\r\n\r\nEach Series has been initially sold in multiple variants defined by the watch casing's material, color, and size (except for the budget watches Series 1 and SE, available only in aluminum, and the Ultra, available only in 49 mm uncolored titanium), and beginning with Series 3, by the option in the aluminum variants for LTE cellular connectivity, which comes standard with the other materials. The band included with the watch can be selected from multiple options from Apple, and watch variants in aluminum co-branded with Nike and in stainless steel co-branded with Hermès are also offered, which include exclusive bands, colors, and digital watch faces carrying those companies' branding.\r\n\r\nThe Apple Watch operates in conjunction with the user's iPhone for functions such as configuring the watch and syncing data with iPhone apps, but can separately connect to a Wi-Fi network for data-reliant purposes, including communications, app use, and audio streaming. LTE-equipped models can also perform these functions over a mobile network, and can make and receive phone calls independently when the paired iPhone is not nearby or is powered-off, substantially reducing the need for an iPhone after initial setup.[b] The oldest iPhone model that is compatible with any given Apple Watch depends on the version of system software installed on each device. As of September 2022, new Apple Watches come with watchOS 9 preinstalled and require an iPhone running iOS 16, which is available for the iPhone 8 and later.",

      "description": "Native Union steps up to 140W GaN Charger\r\nNative Union is stepping up to the big leagues with a new multi-device charging station. Its most capable solution yet for refueling all of your gadgets at once, the new Native Union 140W GaN Charger arrives with a 4-port design.\r\n\r\nAble to use all four ports at once thanks to the Gallium nitride tech, it sports dynamic power allocation that can redirect the 140W of power to any of the ports. That ensures that you can plug a M2 Pro MacBook Pro into one of the slots, knowing that once it quickly fuels up with the full power allowance, other devices will then be able to take advantage of the higher output.\r\nThe form-factor is very similar to what we’ve seen from other models on the market, too. Instead of plugging right into the wall, the Native Union 140W GaN Charger sports a braided cable that plugs into the wall. That way, you can position it on your desk, nightstand, or somewhere else and actually have better access to all four ports.\r\n\r\nBy far one of the biggest ways that the new Native Union 140W GaN Charging Station stands out from the competition is that it taps recycled materials for the build. Made of 90% recycled plastics, the exterior shell is a bit more environmentally-friendly than we’re used to seeing with these kinds of chargers.\r\n\r\nThe plastic form-factor also pairs with an option stand that keeps the charger upright and in place. It’s a bit more premium than we’ve seen from the likes of other brands, opting for an aluminum accessory instead of just another piece of plastic.",

The fourth-generation iPad Pro, introduced in March 2020, included the A12Z chip, and was introduced alongside the Magic Keyboard. The fifth-generation iPad Pro, announced in April 2021, incorporated a desktop-class M1 chip, making it the first iPad model to not use an A-series processor. The sixth- and current-generation iPad Pro, introduced in October 2022, includes the M2 chip, Apple Pencil Hover, and ProRes video.",
