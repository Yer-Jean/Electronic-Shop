      "description": "AirPods Max have an H1 chip in each ear cup, which is also found in the second-generation AirPods and first-generation AirPods Pro. AirPods Max, like the AirPods Pro, come with Apple's Active Noise Cancellation technology for blocking outside noise, and Transparency mode for listening to sounds around users. The \"Digital Crown\", similar to that of the Apple Watch, allows users to play or pause audio, control volume, skip tracks, control phone calls, and activate Siri. Proximity sensors automatically detect when they are on a user's head and play or pause audio accordingly. Spatial audio uses built-in gyroscopes and accelerometers to track movement of the user's head and provide what Apple describes as a \"theater-like\" experience.\r\n\r\nApple claims 20 hours of battery life, with five minutes of charging delivering 1.5 hours of listening time. AirPods Max are charged via the Lightning port. The Lightning port can also be used for line-in audio, with Apple selling cables with USB-A, USB-C and 3.5mm headphone ends.\r\n\r\nAirPods Max are bundled with a Smart Case for storing. The Smart Case includes magnets that switch AirPods Max to low-power mode.\r\n\r\nAirPods Max is available in five colors: Space Gray, Silver, Sky Blue, Green, and Pink. Users can select from these five colors separately for the ear cushions and external chassis for a total of 25 color combinations (or 125 if using two different ear cushion colors).",
